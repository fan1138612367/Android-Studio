      <item value="Creates an instance of a cold Flow with elements that are sent to a SendChannel provided to the builder's block of code via ProducerScope. It allows elements to be produced by code that is running in a different context or concurrently. The resulting flow is cold, which means that block is called every time a terminal operator is applied to the resulting flow. This builder ensures thread-safety and context preservation, thus the provided ProducerScope can be used concurrently from different contexts. The resulting flow completes as soon as the code in the block and all its children completes. Use awaitClose as the last statement to keep it running. A more detailed example is provided in the documentation of callbackFlow. A channel with the default buffer size is used. Use the buffer operator on the resulting flow to specify a user-defined value and to control what happens when data is produced faster than consumed, i.e. to control the back-pressure behavior. Adjacent applications of channelFlow, flowOn, buffer, and produceIn are always fused so that only one properly configured channel is used for execution. Examples of usage:" />

      <item value="Sends the specified element to this channel, suspending the caller while the buffer of this channel is full or if it does not exist, or throws an exception if the channel is closed for send (see close for details). Closing a channel after this function has suspended does not cause this suspended send invocation to abort, because closing a channel is conceptually like sending a special &quot;close token&quot; over this channel. All elements sent over the channel are delivered in first-in first-out order. The sent element will be delivered to receivers before the close token. This suspending function is cancellable. If the Job of the current coroutine is cancelled or completed while this function is suspended, this function immediately resumes with a CancellationException. There is a prompt cancellation guarantee. If the job was cancelled while this function was suspended, it will not resume successfully. The send call can send the element to the channel, but then throw CancellationException, thus an exception should not be treated as a failure to deliver the element. See &quot;Undelivered elements&quot; section in Channel documentation for details on handling undelivered elements. Note that this function does not check for cancellation when it is not suspended. Use yield or CoroutineScope.isActive to periodically check for cancellation in tight loops if needed. This function can be used in select invocations with the onSend clause. Use trySend to try sending to this channel without waiting." />
      <item value="Marks the annotated declaration as deprecated. A deprecated API element is not recommended to use, typically because it's being phased out or a better alternative exists. To help removing deprecated API gradually, the property level could be used. Usually a gradual phase-out goes through the &quot;warning&quot;, then &quot;error&quot;, then &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;removed&quot; stages: First and by default, DeprecationLevel.WARNING is used to notify API consumers, but not to break their compilation or runtime usages. Then, some time later the deprecation level is raised to DeprecationLevel.ERROR, so that no new Kotlin code can be compiled using the deprecated API. Finally, the API is either removed entirely, or hidden (DeprecationLevel.HIDDEN) from code, so its usages look like unresolved references, while the API remains in the compiled code preserving binary compatibility with previously compiled code." />
