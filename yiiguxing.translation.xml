      <item value="Marks the annotated declaration as deprecated. A deprecated API element is not recommended to use, typically because it's being phased out or a better alternative exists. To help removing deprecated API gradually, the property level could be used. Usually a gradual phase-out goes through the &quot;warning&quot;, then &quot;error&quot;, then &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;removed&quot; stages: First and by default, DeprecationLevel.WARNING is used to notify API consumers, but not to break their compilation or runtime usages. Then, some time later the deprecation level is raised to DeprecationLevel.ERROR, so that no new Kotlin code can be compiled using the deprecated API. Finally, the API is either removed entirely, or hidden (DeprecationLevel.HIDDEN) from code, so its usages look like unresolved references, while the API remains in the compiled code preserving binary compatibility with previously compiled code." />
      <item value="Marks the annotated declaration as deprecated. In contrast to Deprecated, severity of the reported diagnostic is not a constant value, but differs depending on the API version of the usage (the value of the -api-version argument when compiling the module where the usage is located). If the API version is greater or equal than hiddenSince, the declaration will not be accessible from the code (as if it was deprecated with level DeprecationLevel.HIDDEN), otherwise if the API version is greater or equal than errorSince, the usage will be marked as an error (as with DeprecationLevel.ERROR), otherwise if the API version is greater or equal than warningSince, the usage will be marked as a warning (as with DeprecationLevel.WARNING), otherwise the annotation is ignored." />

      <item value="When LaunchedEffect enters the composition it will launch block into the composition's CoroutineContext. The coroutine will be cancelled and re-launched when LaunchedEffect is recomposed with a different key1. The coroutine will be cancelled when the LaunchedEffect leaves the composition. This function should not be used to (re-)launch ongoing tasks in response to callback events by way of storing callback data in MutableState passed to key1. Instead, see rememberCoroutineScope to obtain a CoroutineScope that may be used to launch ongoing jobs scoped to the composition in response to event callbacks." />

The transaction will be marked as successful unless an exception is thrown in the suspending block or the coroutine is cancelled.

Performing blocking database operations is not permitted in a coroutine scope other than the one received by the suspending block. It is recommended that all Dao function invoked within the block be suspending functions. The dispatcher used to execute the given block will utilize threads from Room's query executor." />
