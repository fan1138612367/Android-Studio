The coroutine will be cancelled and re-launched when LaunchedEffect is recomposed with a different key1. The coroutine will be cancelled when the LaunchedEffect leaves the composition. This function should not be used to (re-)launch ongoing tasks in response to callback events by way of storing callback data in MutableState passed to key1. Instead, see rememberCoroutineScope to obtain a CoroutineScope that may be used to launch ongoing jobs scoped to the composition in response to event callbacks." />

Performing blocking database operations is not permitted in a coroutine scope other than the one received by the suspending block. It is recommended that all Dao function invoked within the block be suspending functions. The dispatcher used to execute the given block will utilize threads from Room's query executor." />
